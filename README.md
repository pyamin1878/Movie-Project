## Data Understanding
We were given 5 raw datasets from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/), [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/), [The numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/), [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), and [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) located in the [Data](https://github.com/pyamin1878/Movie-Project/tree/main/Data) directory. 

From these datasets the ones that proved most insightful for our analysis were from IMDb and The Numbers. IMDb contained a SQL database with plenty of data points on movies and ratings. The Numbers on the otherhand displayed financials such as domestic and international revenue, as well as production budgets for movies. 

In order to form concious business decisions we will analyze which movies are the most popular and to see if a correlation between popularity and profitability exist.
